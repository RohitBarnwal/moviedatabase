# moviedatabase
REQUIREMENTS

    python2.7
    App Engine SDK - Development tools for Google App Engine 

Created and tested using python 2.7 App engine SDK 1.9.25 on ubuntu 13.04.

Steps: 

1. Install the Python SDK for Google App Engine

2. To start project on your local ubuntu machine, execute this from your terminal:
~/workspace_new/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py ~/workspace_new/moviedatabase/

Make sure, you have google app engine files after unzipping (https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/google_appengine_1.9.33.zip)
in the correct folder. I have put both app engine folder and my project moviedatabase in my workspace only.

3. Congratulations your server is running at http://localhost:8080
 and datastore can be seen at http://localhost:8000
